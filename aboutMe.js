I love Computer Science because it makes me want to pull my hair out, jump for joy, and cry tears of sleep deprivation....all at once.", 
	"part2":"As a third year at Northeastern University, I have completed my first co-op at Intuit in Mountain View California where I worked on Quickbooks Online's Payroll API. Fun fact: I won the creative writing award in high school and love writing poetry. Check out some of my projects below!"
