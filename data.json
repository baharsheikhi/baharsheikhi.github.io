Going to a large school like Northeastern, me and 3 other classmates decided that we wanted to help out freshmen, sophomores, and transfer students who feel like they often miss out on campus-events. Before even touching code, we spent a few months sketching, researching, prototyping, and testing. We engaged in UX design via personas and scenarios. We ended up developing the front end of this design that we came up with.",
		"how":"I was a front-end developer for this project created the data models in Swift that were used throughout the interface. I created delegates for UITableView classes and added custon code for search functionality, categorizing events, and displaying RSVP'd events on the home screen."
